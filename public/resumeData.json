    "bio": "Welcome! I'm Jas, a dedicated software engineer and a proud graduate in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Bath. Today, I bring my passion for problem-solving and design to life as a freelance software developer, crafting bespoke apps and websites for a diverse range of clients.\nCreating, building, and perfecting software isn't just my profession—it's my calling. I truly believe in the transformative power of well-crafted digital tools, and I am committed to delivering solutions that elevate my clients' visions and enhance their digital experiences.\nBut my work extends beyond the realms of code and design. Inspired by my Sikh faith and the guiding principle of Seva—selfless service—I am driven to use my skills to benefit others. Whether it's helping businesses to flourish, aiding individuals to navigate their digital needs, or contributing to humanitarian causes, the heart of my work lies in serving others.\nJoin me on this journey as we shape the digital future, one line of code at a time.",
